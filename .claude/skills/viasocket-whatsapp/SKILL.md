  Integrate WhatsApp into this product through the viaSocket Apps API: render a connect
  button, capture the user's connection, populate pickers with their real data, run
  WhatsApp actions from the backend, and subscribe to WhatsApp events. Use whenever the
  task involves connecting a third-party app for an end user, reading the choices a field
  accepts, running an action in that app, or receiving its events.

# WhatsApp via the viaSocket Apps API

> Source: https://flow.viasocket.com/documentation/rowfgty2478l.md?format=http. Public, no sign-in. Fetch it again for the
> latest version of this file; it is generated from the live catalog.

viaSocket owns the integration with the app. Your code never talks to the app, never holds
its credentials and never refreshes its tokens — you make the five calls below and we do
that part. Your user authorises through the app’s own consent screen.

What that buys you, concretely:

- **Credentials you never see.** Each user’s WhatsApp tokens live encrypted in viaSocket’s vault and are
  refreshed there; a leak of your database leaks no third-party access.
- **One contract for WhatsApp and 2,300 other apps.** The same five calls, the same `{ label, value }` options,
  the same event handler shape, whichever app the user connects next.
- **Triggers done for you.** Polling where the app has no webhooks, de-duplication, renewal, delivery.
- **A runtime for your logic, not just a proxy.** An event handler is JavaScript we run in an isolated
  sandbox per event, with every app this user connected one `fetch` away and no secret in the code. So
  "when X, do Y" needs no server of yours, no deploy and nothing public, and `update-subscribed-event`
  swaps a live handler in place rather than shipping a release.
- **Real data for pickers.** `list-options` returns the user’s own channels, sheets and boards,
  searchable where the app’s list is large.
- **This file is generated from the live catalog.** Every id and field is current; refetch it rather than
  trusting a copy.

This file calls the HTTP API directly, through one small client you write yourself (below).
Any language works; the examples are JavaScript.

## What you are building

1. A **connect button** in your UI that opens WhatsApp's consent screen and gives you an `auth_id`.
2. **Pickers** in your UI filled with the user's real WhatsApp data, one call per field.
3. **Actions** — enable the app once for a `script_id`, then run them from your backend.
4. **Events** — when something happens in the app, a short handler of yours runs on our
   servers: it runs an action in another app, calls your API, or both. Your server is not in the path.

> Enabling is only for actions. A trigger subscription needs the `auth_id` and nothing
> else, so an integration that only listens for events never calls `/embed/enable`.

## Rules that are not negotiable

1. **The signing secret and the embed token are server-side only.** Sign the token on your
   backend; hand the frontend only what one popup needs.
2. **A `script_id` is a credential.** Anyone holding it can run that app as that user.
   Store it like a password and never ship it to the browser.
3. **Ids are fetched, never guessed.** Repository ids, channel ids, sheet ids — every one
   comes from `POST /embed/list-options`. A hardcoded id fails confusingly, not clearly.
4. **`existingFields` is not optional when a field depends on another.** Options are scoped
   by it; `{}` for a dependent field returns nothing useful.
5. **A nested key is addressed by its whole path.** `inputData` nests — `{ destination: {
   channel_id } }` — and the API addresses that field as `destination.channel_id`. So
   `fieldKey` is the **full dotted path**, never the leaf, and `existingFields` carries the
   value **nested exactly as inputData does**, never flattened:

   ```json
   { "fieldKey": "destination.thread_ts",
     "existingFields": { "destination": { "thread_channel_id": "C082WLRJLAA" } } }
   ```

   A leaf `fieldKey`, or a flat `"destination.thread_channel_id"` key in `existingFields`,
   matches no field: the call succeeds and returns nothing. Every field table below writes
   its keys in this full form, and the `inputData` sample beside each one shows the object
   those paths nest into. **Keys are case-sensitive and differ between actions of this app**
   (Google Sheets: `spreadsheet_Id` in one action, `spreadSheet_id` in another, `spreadsheet_id` in
   a third). A key from another action matches nothing, silently. Copy each key from the table
   of the action you are calling, character for character; never type one from memory. The
   parameter that carries it is `fieldKey` — not `blockKey`, not `field`.
6. **Normalise the list-options response.** Some fields wrap their list under `data.data`
   (with an `offset` you ignore); a plain field returns the array as `data`. Items are always
   `{ label, value }` — show the label, send the value. One helper, both shapes, no paging.
   A connection that cannot be read (revoked, or another user's `auth_id`) is answered with **200 and `success: true`**, the failure nested as `data.response.status` 400 and `data.response.data.message`. Treat that as the error it is; never render it as an empty list.
   A field marked **searchable** (`enableSearchApi` in the schema) takes what the user typed as
   `existingFields._searchText`, inside existingFields next to the dependency values. The field
   tables mark it.
7. **One `unique_identifier` per end user, forever.** Connections and subscriptions are
   isolated by it. Change it and the user appears to have lost their connection.
8. **A field of type `object` is not a single choice.** Fetch it like any other field —
   the response is the same `{ label, value }` list — then use *every* option’s `value` as a
   key, **verbatim**, and supply a value for each: `{ "<option value>": "<your value>" }`. The
   value is opaque: `name@longtext` is the whole key, however much it looks like a name plus a
   type. Never send the label, a lowercased label, or the value with a suffix removed.
9. **Enable only when you need actions, and never twice.** Subscribing to an event needs
   the connection and nothing more. Before enabling, look the flows up (see “Managing what
   a user already has”) — the `script_id` you want may already exist.
10. **A subscription needs a handler: `code`, a string of JavaScript we run on viaSocket’s
    servers each time the event fires.** It is what makes “when X happens in this app, do Y”
    work with no server of yours in the path. In scope there: `axios`, `fetch`, and `context`;
    the event is `context.req.body`. It stands alone: no `import`/`require`, nothing from this
    codebase; anything of yours it needs (a `script_id`, a picked id, an API key) is baked into
    the string when you subscribe. `webhook` is the edge case, not the default: pass it only
    when the product wants raw events pushed to a public endpoint of its own. Never both.

## Environment

```bash
# Your org signing secret, from the viaSocket Install Code page. Backend only.
VIASOCKET_EMBED_SECRET=...

# Fixed for this integration.
VIASOCKET_ORG_ID=4160

## Calling it

One server-side module, no dependency beyond a JWT library. Every call except the connect popup goes through it,
and every example further down uses these function names.

```js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'

const API = process.env.VIASOCKET_API_URL
const RUN = process.env.VIASOCKET_RUN_URL

 * uniqueIdentifier is YOUR stable id for the signed-in end user (a user id, an email hash).

export async function updateSubscription(uniqueIdentifier, subscriptionScriptId, changes) {
  return call(`/embed/update-subscribed-event/${subscriptionScriptId}`, uniqueIdentifier, changes, "PUT")
}
```

## Step 1 — the connect button (frontend)

The only browser-side piece. Use WhatsApp's own icon so the button is recognisable.

```html
<button id="connect-app" class="your-button">
  <img src="https://stuff.thingsofbrand.com/viasocket.com/images/imge_whatsapp.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />
  Connect WhatsApp
</button>

<script>
  // Your backend signs this for the signed-in user.
  const embedToken = await fetch("/api/viasocket/token").then((r) => r.text())

  document.getElementById("connect-app").onclick = () =>
    openViasocketConnection(embedToken, "rowfgty2478l")

  window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
    if (event.data?.type === "viasocket_connection_success") {
      // The connection id IS the auth_id every later call takes. Hand it to your
      // backend, which enables the app and stores the script_id it gets back.
      const authId = event.data.data.id
      await fetch("/api/viasocket/connected", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ serviceId: event.data.serviceId, authId })
      })
      showConnected()
    } else if (event.data?.type === "viasocket_connection_error") {
      showError(event.data.error?.message)
    } else if (event.data?.type === "viasocket_connection_closed") {
      // Popup closed early. Nothing was created; leave the button as it was.
    }
  })
</script>

<script id="viasocket-connect-script" src="https://embed.viasocket.com/prod-connectcomponent.js"></script>
```

Then, on your backend, for that user:

```js
// Only if you are going to run actions — subscribing to events needs just the authId.
let scriptId = await findEnabledApp(uniqueIdentifier, 'rowfgty2478l')
if (!scriptId) scriptId = await enableApp(uniqueIdentifier, authId)
// store scriptId against (uniqueIdentifier, "rowfgty2478l")
```

## WhatsApp

- `service_id`: `rowfgty2478l`
- icon: https://stuff.thingsofbrand.com/viasocket.com/images/imge_whatsapp.svg
- auth: NoAuth
- 1 actions, 0 triggers

## How to render a picker for any field

This is the part that is not obvious. To show the user a dropdown of WhatsApp values —
repositories, channels, boards, spreadsheets — you do **not** need the action you intend to
run. You need *any* action or trigger that exposes that field, and you call list-options on
that one's `action_version_id`. The field key is the same wherever it appears.

This table gives the cheapest source for every fetchable field of this app: the action with
the fewest prerequisites. Use it to build pickers before you have decided which action the
user is ultimately running.

Every key below is the **full path**, which is exactly what `fieldKey` takes. Where one has a
dot in it the field lives inside an object, so its value is nested under that path in both
`existingFields` and `inputData`.

| field key | label | needs first | search | call list-options on | (that action) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agentCreationHelp` | agentCreationHelp | — | — | `row6abwtcuu0` | Send WhatsApp Message |
| `name` | Template | — | — | `row6abwtcuu0` | Send WhatsApp Message |
| `components` | Template Field | `name` | — | `row6abwtcuu0` | Send WhatsApp Message |
| `gaooXaGs` | Template Preview | `name` | — | `row6abwtcuu0` | Send WhatsApp Message |

"searchable": the field has `enableSearchApi`; send what the user typed, debounced, as `existingFields._searchText` — inside existingFields, next to the dependency values. A new text starts a new list.

Worked example — a picker for `agentCreationHelp`:

```js
// Send WhatsApp Message is just the cheapest place this field appears.
const { options } = await listOptions(uniqueIdentifier, 'row6abwtcuu0', 'agentCreationHelp', {}, authId)

// options is [{ label, value }] — render label, submit value.
renderSelect(options)
```

## Rendering a form for any action

Only when the end user configures an action themselves. A fixed feature needs one picker from
the field index above, not a form. Every action and trigger below is described by the same
field schema, so one renderer serves all of them: give it an `action_version_id`, it draws the
form and produces `inputData`.

| column in the tables below | render as | behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type `string`, `number`, `date`, `html`, `markdown` | text input (number/date typed) | free text from your user |
| type `boolean` | yes / no | send `true` / `false` |
| type `dropdown` | single select | options from the `value comes from` column |
| type `multiselect` | multi select | send an array of values |
| type `object` | a card containing its child fields (the keys with a dot prefix) | nest the children under the parent key in `inputData` |
| type `dictionary` | key / value rows | send an object |
| type `aifield` | free text | a description the platform turns into structured input; send a string |
| `value comes from: one of …` | static options | those literal values |
| `value comes from: list-options` | select that fetches on open | await listOptions(uniqueIdentifier, versionId, fieldKey, existingFields, authId); show `label`, send `value` |
| `list-options (searchable)` | the same, with a search box | debounce typing and send it as `existingFields._searchText`; a new text starts a new list |
| `needs first` / `list-options after X` | disabled until X has a value | put X's current value in `existingFields`, nested exactly as `inputData`; clear this field when X changes |
| `only applies when …` | hidden unless the condition holds | leave hidden fields out of `inputData` entirely |
| `required: yes` | validation | block submit while empty and visible |

`fieldKey` for a fetch is always the full dotted path in the table. The result is the same
`inputData` shape as the sample under each action; submit it unchanged.

The complete recipe — the raw schema and where to get it, the eight rules, a framework-free
form engine and a React skin with paging and search — is its own document. Fetch it when you
build the form:

```http
GET https://flow.viasocket.com/documentation/form-renderer.md
```

This app's raw schema: `POST https://flow.sokt.io/func/scriolZue69X` with `{"service_id":"rowfgty2478l"}`.

## Actions

Run any of these with `runAction(scriptId, action_version_id, inputData)`.


### Send WhatsApp Message

- `action_version_id`: `row6abwtcuu0`
- Send a WhatsApp message using an approved template or a custom freeform text within an active session.
- fetch first: `name`, `agentCreationHelp`, `components`, `gaooXaGs`

| key | type | required | value comes from | only applies when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | dropdown | yes | list-options |  |
| `components` | object | no | list-options after name, one key per option: each option's value, verbatim | applies when name_extraValue |
| `gaooXaGs` | object | yes | list-options after name, one key per option: each option's value, verbatim | applies when name.length>0 |
| `to` | string | yes | your user |  |

```js
const result = await runAction(scriptId, 'row6abwtcuu0', {
  "name": "<id from list-options>",
  "components": {
    "<option value, verbatim, e.g. name@longtext>": "<your value>"
  },
  "gaooXaGs": {
    "<option value, verbatim, e.g. name@longtext>": "<your value>"
  },
  "to": "<to>"
})
```

A real sample of what this call returns:

```json
{
  "request_id": "req_1",
  "credits_used": 1
}
```

## Managing what a user already has

All four are scoped to the `unique_identifier` in the token, so they answer for one end user.

| call | what it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `GET https://flow-api.viasocket.com/projects/projj1a8ky8Q/integrations` | Every flow this user has. Match `service_id` to find an app they already enabled, and to recover a `script_id`. |
| `PUT https://flow-api.viasocket.com/embed/updatestatus/<script_id>?status=0` | Disable an enabled app, or end a trigger subscription. `status=1` re-enables. |
| `GET https://flow-api.viasocket.com/embed/authentications` | Every app this user has connected. |
| `DELETE https://flow-api.viasocket.com/embed/authentications/revoke/<auth_id>` | Disconnect an app. Disable its flows first. |

The flows list:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "flows": [
  {
    "title": "rowqm5xi2",
    "status": "active",
    "webhook": "https://flow.sokt.io/func/scriRx0PKDEG",
    "auth_id": "auth2c38gFVg_rowqm5xi2",
    "service_id": "rowqm5xi2",
    "id": "scriRx0PKDEG"
  }
] } }
```

`id` is the `script_id`. The list carries no `inputData` and no handler, so a subscription is not
identifiable from it alone: match `id` against the subscription records you saved (Triggers section).

The other two responses:

- `updatestatus` returns the **entire flow record** — its generated script, its whole
  `json_script`, its metadata. Ignore all of it and check `data.status`: `"0"` disabled,
  `"1"` active.
- `revoke` returns `{ "success": true, "message": "Successfully deleted authentication data",
  "data": [] }`. The empty array is normal; success is the signal.

## When it goes wrong

| symptom | cause |
| --- | --- |
| 401 / invalid token | Signed with the wrong secret, or the payload is missing `org_id` / `project_id` / `unique_identifier`. |
| Empty option list | `existingFields` is missing something this field depends on, or the `auth_id` belongs to a different `unique_identifier`. |
| Empty option list on a nested field | `fieldKey` was the leaf instead of the full path, or `existingFields` was flattened to dotted keys instead of nested. Both match nothing, and neither errors. |
| A field is ignored, or the record is created empty | An option’s `value` was altered before being used as a key (`name` sent for `name@longtext`), or a key was typed from a label. Keys are each option’s `value`, verbatim. |
| Empty option list, key looks right | Its casing is from another action of this app (`spreadsheet_id` vs `spreadsheet_Id`), or the request said `blockKey` instead of `fieldKey`. Compare with this action’s table, character for character. |
| `options.map is not a function` | The wrapped shape (`data.data`) was not normalised. |
| Picker empty, response is 200 with `data.response.status` 400 | The connection cannot be read: revoked, or the `auth_id` belongs to another `unique_identifier`. The message is in `data.response.data.message`; reconnect the app. |
| App rejects the action | An id was hardcoded instead of fetched, or two mutually exclusive keys were both sent — see the "only applies when" column. |
| Handler never runs | The subscription was created against a different `auth_id`, or `inputData` did not match the event (wrong label, wrong sheet). |
| Handler runs, the action inside it fails | The `script_id` baked into the handler belongs to another user, or that app was never enabled for this user; or the `inputData` keys do not match the other app’s document. Read the response `message`. |
| Someone asks for a webhook URL | Nobody needs one for “when X, do Y”: the handler does Y itself. A webhook is only for pushing raw events to a public endpoint the product chose to expose. |
| The same event fires twice | Subscribed twice for one user. Check the saved subscription record before subscribing; remove the duplicate with its `script_id`. |
| Connection appears lost | A different `unique_identifier` was used for the same end user. |
| Two script_ids for one app | `enableApp` ran without checking `findEnabledApp` first. |
